<h1>Excluded songs</h1>
<h2>The page contains 100% more awful HTML!</h2>
<p><b>Excuse</b> Not in the game. As C418 states, "I ultimately decided that 'Excuse' would be one of several exclusive songs only to be found on this record."</p>
<p><b>Death</b> Death <i>is</i> one of these exclusive songs. I have not found the others yet, however I will look into it as soon as I can!</p>
<p><b>Pigstep - Mono Mix</b> While this is in Minecraft, the stereo mix is higher quality and renders what it is supposed to sound like. In the real game, the audio was changed from stereo sound (left and right channels) to mono sound (one channel for both left and right). Go ahead, compare mono to stereo! It sounds... much worse, at least to me. Sorry for subjecting EVERYONE to this, but <i>stereo for life.</i></p>

<p>If you don't like this removal, here's the "full experience". <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3NAEmDSGyHtQEoCfh3cowt?si=5mpn23WJTcKX9xdWNtmVuQ">I hope you're happy.</a></p>
<p>Fan songs will not EVER be included. I despise playlists that randomly start playing some alternate song that has no part in the real soundtrack.</p>
