<title>Excluded songs</title>
<p>Minimalist HTML, WOOOOOO</p>
</br>
<p><b>Excuse</b> Not in the game. As C418 states, "I ultimately decided that 'Excuse' would be one of several exclusive songs only to be found on this record."</p>
<p><b>Death</b> Death <i>is</i> one of these exclusive songs. I have not found the others yet, however I will look into it as soon as I can!</p>
<p><b>Pigstep - Mono Mix</b> While this is in Minecraft, the stereo mix is higher quality and renders what it is supposed to sound like. In the real game, the audio was changed from stereo sound (left and right channels) to mono sound (one channel for both left and right), which, well, unless you enjoy having music inside your noggin, stereo for life.</p>
</br>
<p>If you don't like this removal, I am currently working on creating one that contains both versions of Pigstep, alongside removed tracks, for the "full" experience.</p>
