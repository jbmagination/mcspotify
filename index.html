<h1>Excluded songs</h1>
<h2>The page contains 100% more awful HTML!</h2>
<p>Woah, you actually visited this page! Hey! Basically this page only really contains excluded songs and unaccessible songs so let's get to it.</p>
</br>
<h3>Excluded songs</h3>
<p><b>C418 - Excuse</b> isn't in the game. As C418 states on the Minecraft: Volume Alpha page, "I ultimately decided that 'Excuse' would be one of several exclusive songs only to be found on this record."</p>
<p>And <b>Door</b>, <b>Death</b>, <b>Living Mice</b>, <b>Moog City</b>, <b>Ã‰quinoxe</b>, <b>Chris</b>, <b>Beginning</b>, <b>Ki</b>, <b>Flake</b>, <b>Kyoto</b>, and <b>Intro</b> are all the exclusive songs I could find. Keep in mind that this comes from my personal listening in Minecraft plus the Minecraft wiki pages seen <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Music#List">here</a> and <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Music_Disc#Discs"</a>here</a>. Note that the wiki pages are not fully up to date.</p>
<p><b>Lena Raine - Pigstep (Mono Mix)</b> is in Minecraft, but the stereo mix is higher quality and renders what it is supposed to sound like. In the real game, the audio was changed from stereo sound (left and right channels) to mono sound (one channel for both left and right). Go ahead, compare mono to stereo! It sounds... much worse, at least to me. Sorry for subjecting EVERYONE to this, but <i>stereo for life.</i></p>
<p>Additionally, any fan song or remix that is created won't be included here. This is a playlist that contains <i>a soundtrack</i>, not <i>bundles of fan creations</i>.</p>
</br>
<h3>Unaccessible songs</h3>
<p><b>C418 - 11</b> is one of the songs that was never released on Spotify, and likely never will be. Without the use of local files, which requires a lot of work to set up for a playlist, adding that disc to a Spotify playlist is a dream that can't be accomplished. Yet.</p>
<p><b>C418 - Boss</b></p> also has this same treatment.</p>
</br>
<h3><i>"But I like that stuff!"</i></h3>
<p>If you don't like this removal, here's as much of the "full experience" as I can give you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3NAEmDSGyHtQEoCfh3cowt?si=5mpn23WJTcKX9xdWNtmVuQ">I hope you're happy.</a></p>
